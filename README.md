# Fitting-2D-linear-model-to-N-2-training-points
## Deliverables 
(a) Deriving solutions for parameters a and b of a linear model y = ax + b using N training data samples. 
(b) Implementing a Python function to compute and return a and b using your own derivations. 
(c) Writing a Python program to collect N points from the user with a mouse, plot the points, and fit a linear model.
